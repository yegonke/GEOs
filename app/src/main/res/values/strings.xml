    <string name="a_about">Kipngetich Yegon is a Geomatics engineer by profession. In his free time he likes researching on science and testing practicality of some pre-stated theories. Information sharing has always been a problem and this , as Yegon believes, is the reason behind slow growth in the broad Geomatics field. Business is the other key source of income in the current society where getting a job can be stressful. This project is one of the things Yegon thought would be source of information as well as money that will help enlighten the people and in return earn a living. You may be impressed by my work and would like to follow my path.If so, then head to the feedback section (floating button at landing page) and press any of the button as deems fit to you and we will communicate and maybe start the journey you dreamt . God Bless. Thankyou.</string>
